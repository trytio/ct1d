# Story Close

## Purpose

Complete a story by verifying the retrospective, merging to the development branch, cleaning up the story branch, and updating epic tracking.

## Mastery Levels (ShuHaRi)

- **Shu**: Follow all steps, verify retrospective, merge with --no-ff, update epic
- **Ha**: Adjust merge strategy for small fixes, skip epic update for standalone
- **Ri**: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines, automate cleanup workflows

## Context

**When to use:** After `/rai-story-review` retrospective is complete. Story is verified and tests pass.

**When to skip:** Story abandoned (document why, delete branch without merge, update epic as "Abandoned").

**Inputs:** Completed retrospective, passing test suite, story branch ready for merge.

**Branch config:** Read `branches.development` from `.raise/manifest.yaml` for `{dev_branch}`. Default: `main`.

## Steps

### Step 1: Verify Retrospective & Tests

```bash
RETRO="work/epics/e{N}-{name}/stories/{story_id}-retrospective.md"
[ -f "$RETRO" ] && echo "✓ Retrospective" || echo "ERROR: Run /rai-story-review first"
```

Determine which test command to run using this priority chain:

1. **Check `.raise/manifest.yaml`** for `project.test_command` — if set, use it directly (configuration over convention)
2. **Detect language** from `project.project_type` in manifest, or scan file extensions of changed files (`git diff --name-only`)
3. **Map language to default** using the table below

| Language | Extensions | Default Test Command |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| Python | `.py`, `.pyi` | `uv run pytest --tb=short` |
| TypeScript | `.ts`, `.tsx` | `npx vitest run` or `npm test` |
| JavaScript | `.js`, `.jsx` | `npx vitest run` or `npm test` |
| C# | `.cs` | `dotnet test --verbosity quiet` |
| Go | `.go` | `go test ./...` |
| PHP | `.php` | `vendor/bin/phpunit` |
| Dart | `.dart` | `flutter test` |
| Unknown | — | Ask developer |

The table is a **fallback** — `project.test_command` always wins when present.

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Retro exists + tests green | Continue |
| Retro missing | Run `/rai-story-review` first — no exceptions |
| Tests failing | Fix before merge |

Check for structural drift: if this story added modules or changed directory structure, update module docs in `governance/architecture/modules/` before closing.

<verification>
Retrospective exists. Tests pass. No undocumented structural changes.
</verification>

### Step 2: Verify Clean Working Tree

```bash
git status --short
```

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Working tree clean | Continue to merge |
| Uncommitted changes from this story | **Commit them** before merge — artifacts must not be orphaned |
| Unrelated changes | Stash or commit separately with `chore:` prefix |

**NEVER merge with uncommitted story artifacts.** Files created during design, plan, or implementation that aren't committed will be silently lost or orphaned on the target branch.

<verification>
`git status` shows clean working tree (or only unrelated files explicitly acknowledged).
</verification>

### Step 3: Merge to Development Branch

Always merge to `{dev_branch}`:

```bash
git checkout {dev_branch}
git pull origin {dev_branch}
git merge --no-ff {story_branch} -m "feat(s{N}.{M}): merge {story-name}

Completed:
- [summary of deliverables]

Co-Authored-By: Rai <rai@humansys.ai>"
```

<verification>
Merge commit created on `{dev_branch}`.
</verification>

<if-blocked>
Merge conflicts → resolve preserving story work.
</if-blocked>

### Step 4: Update Epic Scope

Mark story complete in `work/epics/e{N}-{name}/scope.md`:
- Check the story checkbox: `- [x] S{N}.{M} {name} ✓`
- Update progress tracking table (status, actual time, velocity)

<verification>
Epic scope reflects story completion.
</verification>

### Step 5: Delete Story Branch

```bash
git branch -D story/s{N}.{M}/{slug}
git push origin --delete story/s{N}.{M}/{slug} 2>/dev/null || true
```

<verification>
Story branch deleted (local and remote).
</verification>

### Step 6: Update Context & Emit

1. Update `CLAUDE.local.md` to reflect completion and next story
2. Emit telemetry: `rai signal emit-work story S{N}.{M} --event complete`
3. If the story has a backlog ticket: `rai backlog transition {story_key} done`

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Transition succeeds | Continue |
| Transition fails | Log warning and continue — backlog errors are **non-blocking** for lifecycle |
| No ticket | Skip backlog transition |

<verification>
Local context updated. Telemetry emitted.
</verification>

<if-blocked>
Adapter not configured or transition fails → log and continue. Backlog sync is best-effort; it must never block story close.
</if-blocked>

## Output

| Item | Destination |
|------|-------------|
| Merge commit | `{dev_branch}` with `--no-ff` |
| Epic update | `work/epics/e{N}-{name}/scope.md` |
| Branch cleanup | Story branch deleted |
| Backlog update | via `rai backlog transition` (best-effort) |
| Context update | `CLAUDE.local.md` |

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Retrospective complete before merge (gate)
- [ ] Tests pass before merge
- [ ] Merge uses `--no-ff` to preserve story history
- [ ] Story branch deleted after merge
- [ ] Epic scope updated with completion status
- [ ] Working tree clean before merge — no orphaned artifacts
- [ ] Always merge to `{dev_branch}` — never to an epic branch
- [ ] NEVER merge without retrospective — learnings compound
- [ ] NEVER leave stale branches — clean as you go
