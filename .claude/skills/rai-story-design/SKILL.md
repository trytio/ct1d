# Story Design

## Purpose

Create a lean story specification optimized for both human review (clear intent) and AI alignment (accurate code generation).

## Mastery Levels (ShuHaRi)

- **Shu**: Follow all steps, include examples for every story
- **Ha**: Skip optional sections for simple stories, adjust detail to complexity
- **Ri**: Custom spec patterns for specialized domains

## Context

**When to use:** Before planning any story that involves architectural decisions, multiple approaches, or >3 components.

**When to skip:** Simple stories (<3 components, obvious implementation) → go to `/rai-story-plan`.

**Inputs:** Story from backlog, User Story artifact (`story.md` from `/rai-story-start`), epic scope/design documents.

## Steps

### Step 1: Assess Complexity

| Criterion | Simple | Moderate | Complex |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Components | 1-2 | 3-4 | 5+ |
| Story points | <5 | 5-8 | >8 |
| External integrations | 0-1 | 2-3 | 4+ |
| Algorithm complexity | Trivial | Custom logic | Novel |

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Simple | Skip design → `/rai-story-plan` |
| Moderate | Core sections only |
| Complex | Full spec with optional sections |

**Risk gate:** If story is marked HIGH RISK in epic scope, discuss risks before designing — name concerns, failure modes, and scope boundaries.

**UX gate:** If story touches human interaction (workflows, prompts, DX), recommend `/rai-research` first (~10 min).

**Integration gate:** If story name includes "dogfood", "E2E", or "integration", OR if epic has separate client/server stories developed with mocks — AC MUST include at least one scenario that runs with **real infrastructure** (docker compose, actual DB, real HTTP calls). Unit tests with mocks cannot catch cross-component contract mismatches (auth headers, payload validation, parameter limits).

### Step 2: Frame What & Why

Load `story.md` (from `/rai-story-start`) if it exists — use its User Story as starting frame.

- **Problem**: What gap does this fill? (1-2 sentences)
- **Value**: Why does this matter? (1-2 sentences, measurable or observable)

### Step 3: Describe Approach

Document WHAT you're building and WHY this approach (not detailed HOW):
- Solution approach (1-2 sentences)
- Components affected (list with change type: create/modify/delete)

**For refactoring:** grep all call sites of the target. A half-migration is worse than none.

**For data mutations:** What happens when inputs reference missing entities? Declare the strategy explicitly: reject with error, skip + report count, partial success with warnings. Silent drops are semantic bugs.

**Value preservation gate:** Before finalizing components, ask: "What domain knowledge does this layer provide that a generic pass-through wouldn't?" If the answer is "none", the design may be over-abstracted. If the answer involves config/resolution/mapping that an existing pattern handles differently, check where that responsibility lives in the proven pattern. KISS means simplest that serves the purpose — removing domain intelligence to reduce LOC removes the value proposition.

For complex stories, add: scenarios (Gherkin), algorithm pseudocode, constraints, testing strategy.

Approach is concrete enough to envision examples. Value preservation gate passed.
</verification>

### Step 4: Create Examples (MOST IMPORTANT)

**This section drives AI code generation accuracy more than any other.**

Provide concrete, runnable examples:
1. **API/CLI usage** — how the story is invoked
2. **Expected output** — success + error cases
3. **Data structures** — key models, schemas, types

Use concrete values (not placeholders), correct syntax (not pseudocode), consistent with codebase style.

<verification>
Examples are concrete, runnable, and cover success + error paths.
</verification>

<if-blocked>
Can't envision examples → approach not concrete enough, return to Step 3.
</if-blocked>

### Step 5: Define Acceptance Criteria

If `story.md` has Gherkin AC, reference them here — refine, don't duplicate. If no `story.md`, define from scratch:

- **MUST**: Required for completion (3-5 items, specific and testable)
- **SHOULD**: Nice-to-have (1-3 items)
- **MUST NOT**: Explicit anti-requirements

All criteria must be observable outcomes traceable to value from Step 2.

<verification>
Criteria are specific, testable, and traceable. Spec reviewable in <5 minutes.
</verification>

## Output

After completing all steps, produce the design in two locations:

### 1. Typed artifact (source of truth)

Write a YAML artifact to `.raise/artifacts/s{N}.{M}-design.yaml` with this structure:

```yaml
artifact_type: story-design
version: 1
skill: rai-story-design
created: '{ISO 8601 timestamp}'
story: 'S{N}.{M}'
epic: 'E{N}'
content:
  summary: '{Problem + Value in 1-2 sentences}'
  complexity: simple|moderate|complex
  acceptance_criteria:
    - id: AC1
      description: '{criterion text}'
      verifiable: true
  integration_points:
    - module: '{dotted.module.path}'
      change_type: new|modification|deletion
      files: ['{relative/path.py}']
  decisions:
    - id: D1
      choice: '{what was chosen}'
      rationale: '{why}'
      alternatives_considered: ['{alt1}', '{alt2}']
refs:
  backlog_item: '{RAISE-NNN}'
  epic_scope: 'work/epics/e{N}-{name}/scope.md'
metadata: {}
```

### 2. Human-readable Markdown

Write the design as `work/epics/e{N}-{name}/stories/s{N}.{M}-design.md` — colocated with other story artifacts (story.md, scope.md, plan.md, retrospective.md).

| Item | Destination |
|------|-------------|
| Typed artifact | `.raise/artifacts/s{N}.{M}-design.yaml` |
| Design document | `work/epics/e{N}-{name}/stories/s{N}.{M}-design.md` |
| Next | `/rai-story-plan` |

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Complexity assessed — design depth matches complexity
- [ ] What & Why clear in <2 minutes
- [ ] Examples are concrete and runnable (100% coverage)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria specific and testable (3-5 MUST items)
- [ ] Risk/UX/Integration gates evaluated before designing
- [ ] Data mutation stories declare missing-entity strategy
- [ ] Value preservation gate: domain intelligence preserved, not simplified away
- [ ] Spec creation <30 minutes, review <5 minutes
- [ ] NEVER over-specify HOW — trust AI for implementation details
- [ ] NEVER skip examples — they are the most important section
