# Story Plan

## Purpose

Decompose a story into atomic executable tasks with dependencies, verification criteria, and a deterministic execution order.

## Mastery Levels (ShuHaRi)

- **Shu**: Decompose each story into atomic tasks with full verification criteria
- **Ha**: Adjust granularity based on complexity, parallelize when possible
- **Ri**: Custom planning patterns for specific stacks

## Context

**When to use:** After `/rai-story-design` has grounded integration decisions (or directly for simple stories).

**Prerequisite:** Design document at `work/epics/e{N}-{name}/stories/s{N}.{M}-design.md` (optional for simple stories).

**Inputs:** Story with acceptance criteria, design document (if exists).

## Steps

### Step 1: Verify Design

```bash
ls work/epics/e*/stories/{story_id}-design.md 2>/dev/null || echo "INFO: No design"
```

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Design exists | Load and reference |
| No design + simple story | Continue |
| No design + complex story | Run `/rai-story-design` first |

<verification>
Design loaded or simple story confirmed.
</verification>

### Step 2: Decompose into Tasks

Divide story into atomic, individually verifiable tasks. One commit per task.

| Story Size | Tasks | Rationale |
|------------|:-----:|-----------|
| XS (1-2 SP) | 1-2 | Single-pass implementation |
| S (3-5 SP) | 2-3 | Avoid over-decomposition |
| M (5-8 SP) | 3-5 | Balance granularity and overhead |
| L (8+ SP) | 5-8 | Consider splitting the story |

**Per task:**
- Description, files to create/modify
- TDD cycle: RED (failing test) → GREEN (minimal code) → REFACTOR
- AC reference: link to `story.md` Gherkin scenario (if exists)
- Verification commands (resolve from `.raise/manifest.yaml` first, then language defaults — see `/rai-story-implement` Step 3 for the full priority chain)
- Size (XS/S/M/L) and dependencies

**Always include as final task:** Manual integration test — validate end-to-end with running software.

Each task is atomic and verifiable. Final integration test included.
</verification>

### Step 3: Order & Dependencies

- Map dependencies (sequential vs parallel)
- Apply risk-first ordering (riskiest tasks early)
- Maximize parallelism where no mutual dependencies exist
- Verify no circular dependencies

<verification>
Execution order defined. Dependency graph is acyclic.
</verification>

### Step 4: Document Plan

Create `work/epics/e{N}-{name}/stories/s{N}.{M}-plan.md` with:
- Overview (story ID, size, date)
- Ordered task list with descriptions, files, verification, sizes, dependencies
- Execution order with rationale
- Risks and mitigations
- Duration tracking table (filled during implementation)

<verification>
Plan document complete and reviewable in <5 minutes.
</verification>

## Output

| Item | Destination |
|------|-------------|
| Implementation plan | `work/epics/e{N}-{name}/stories/s{N}.{M}-plan.md` |
| Next | `/rai-story-implement` |

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Design verified or simple story confirmed
- [ ] Tasks are atomic (one commit each) and verifiable
- [ ] TDD cycle specified per task (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- [ ] Final manual integration test task included
- [ ] Dependencies mapped — no cycles
- [ ] Execution order follows risk-first approach
- [ ] NEVER over-decompose simple stories
- [ ] NEVER skip TDD guidance — tests define behavior
