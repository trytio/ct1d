# Story Run

## Purpose

Execute the full story lifecycle in one invocation, pausing only at delegation gates and resuming automatically from the last completed phase.

## Mastery Levels (ShuHaRi)

- **Shu**: Show phase progress, explain each skill's output, pause at both gates
- **Ha**: Brief progress between phases, pause only when delegation says REVIEW
- **Ri**: Minimal output, AUTO delegation, gates stop only on failure

## Context

**When to use:** Starting or resuming any story. Replaces manual sequential skill invocation.

**When to skip:** Single-phase work (e.g., only running review on an already-implemented story). Individual skills remain independently invocable.

## Steps

### Step 0: Detect Phase

Resolve the epic and story paths from `story_id`. Check artifacts in **reverse order** — take the most advanced phase:

| Check | Artifact | If exists → resume at |
|:-----:|----------|----------------------|
| 5 | `stories/s{N}.{M}-retrospective.md` | **close** |
| 4 | `stories/s{N}.{M}-plan.md` | **implement** |
| 3 | `stories/s{N}.{M}-design.md` | **plan** |
| 2 | `stories/s{N}.{M}-story.md` | **design** |
| 1 | story branch exists (`story/s{N}.{M}/*`) | **start** (branch only, no artifacts) |
| 0 | (nothing) | **start** (from scratch) |

Present: "Phase detection: resuming at **{phase}** (found: {artifact})" or "Starting fresh — no artifacts found."

### Step 1: Resolve Delegation

Load developer profile from `~/.rai/developer.yaml`. Resolve delegation level:

| Source | Resolution |
|--------|-----------|
| `delegation.overrides.rai-story-run` | Per-skill override (highest priority) |
| `delegation.default_level` | Explicit default |
| `experience_level` ShuHaRi | Shu→REVIEW, Ha→NOTIFY, Ri→AUTO |
| No profile | Default to REVIEW |

Present: "Delegation: **{level}**"

### Step 2: Execute Skill Chain

Run each skill from the detected phase forward.

**Phase banner (before starting):**

```
── Phase {N}/8: {skill_name} ──
```

**Completion banner (after finishing each phase):**

Use a markdown heading + table so that file paths are clickable in the terminal:

```markdown
### ✔ Phase {N}/8 — {skill_name}

| | File | Status |
|---|---|---|
| + | `path/to/new-file.md` | created |
| ~ | `path/to/modified-file.py` | modified |

**Commits:** 1 (`abc1234`) · **Tests:** 3463 passed
```

Rules for the completion banner:
- Use markdown table (NOT ASCII box-drawing) so file paths are clickable
- File paths in backticks, relative to project root
- `+` for created, `~` for modified, `-` for deleted
- Only list files the skill actually touched (not inherited from prior phases)
- Commits and tests on a single summary line below the table
- For gate phases (design, implement, AR, QR), add verdict/summary on a separate line
- If phase produced no file changes (e.g., close is just merge), show merge commit hash instead of file table

**Chain order:**

| Phase | Skill | Execution | Gate after? |
|:-----:|-------|:---------:|:-----------:|
| 1 | `/rai-story-start {story_id}` | **fork** | — |
| 2 | `/rai-story-design {story_id}` | **fork** | POST-DESIGN |
| 3 | `/rai-story-plan {story_id}` | **fork** | — |
| 4 | `/rai-story-implement {story_id}` | **fork** | POST-IMPLEMENT |
| 5 | `/rai-architecture-review {story_id} story` | **fork** | POST-AR |
| 6 | `/rai-quality-review {story_id}` | **fork** | POST-QR |
| 7 | `/rai-story-review {story_id}` | **fork** | — |
| 8 | `/rai-story-close {story_id}` | **fork** | — |

**All phases fork.** The orchestrator is a pure coordinator — it never executes skill logic directly. This keeps the terminal output clean (subagent output is contained) and the orchestrator context minimal.

#### Fork phases (all 8)

Each fork phase runs in a **fresh-context subagent** via the Agent tool. This eliminates context saturation that degrades quality in later phases.

**For each fork phase:**

1. **Read** the skill's SKILL.md from `src/raise_cli/skills_base/rai-{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
2. **Spawn** an Agent tool subagent with:
   - `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`
   - `prompt`: the agent prompt template below, filled with skill content and story context
3. **Wait** for agent completion
4. **Verify** output:
   - Artifact-producing phases (start, design, plan, implement, review): confirm file exists on disk
   - Verdict phases (AR, QR): read verdict from agent return value
   - Close: confirm merge commit from agent return value
5. **Show** completion banner in main thread
6. **Apply** delegation gate if applicable (in main thread)

**Agent prompt template:**

```
Execute the following skill for story {story_id}.

## Skill Instructions

{paste the full SKILL.md content here}

## Story Context

- Story ID: {story_id}
- Epic: {epic_id}
- Epic path: work/epics/{epic_slug}/
- Stories path: work/epics/{epic_slug}/stories/
- Prior artifacts on disk: {list each file that exists for this story, e.g. s353.2-story.md, s353.2-design.md}

## Your Task

1. Read CLAUDE.md for project-level context and rules
2. Read the prior artifacts listed above from disk
3. Execute every step in the Skill Instructions — no compression, no skipping
4. Write all output artifacts to the correct paths
5. When done, return a brief summary: what you did, artifacts created, and any verdicts or decisions

ARGUMENTS: {story_id}
```

**Critical rules for fork execution:**
- The subagent gets the SKILL.md as its prompt — it executes the full skill naturally in fresh context
- Do NOT pass conversation history or prior phase results to the subagent — only disk artifacts and SKILL.md
- The orchestrator stays thin — it only reads summaries and checks for artifacts between forks
- A skill invoked through fork must produce the same output as when invoked standalone

<if-blocked>
Skill fails → STOP immediately. Report which phase failed and why. The developer re-invokes `/rai-story-run` after fixing the issue — phase detection resumes from the last completed artifact.
</if-blocked>

### Step 3: Apply Delegation Gates

After **phase 2 (design)**, **phase 4 (implement)**, **phase 5 (AR)**, and **phase 6 (QR)**, apply the delegation gate:

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| REVIEW | Present summary of completed phase. Wait for explicit approval before continuing. |
| NOTIFY | Present summary. Continue after 3 seconds unless user intervenes. |
| AUTO | Continue immediately. Gates still stop on test/lint/type failure or AR/QR SIMPLIFY/FAIL verdict. |

**Post-design summary:** Approach, components affected, key decisions.
**Post-implement summary:** Tasks completed, tests passing, files changed.
**Post-AR summary:** Verdict (PASS/PASS WITH QUESTIONS/SIMPLIFY), findings count, key heuristics triggered.
**Post-QR summary:** Verdict (PASS/PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS/FAIL), findings count, fixes applied.

If AR verdict is SIMPLIFY or QR verdict is FAIL, STOP regardless of delegation level. Fixes must be applied before proceeding.

Gate applied. Approval received (REVIEW) or notification shown (NOTIFY/AUTO).

### Step 4: Complete & Report

After all phases complete, present:

```markdown
## Story Run Complete: {story_id}

**Phases:** {start_phase} → close ({N} phases executed)
**Delegation:** {level}
**Result:** Merged to `{parent_branch}` (`{merge_commit_hash}`)

### Artifacts
| Phase | File | Op |
|-------|------|:--:|
| start | `work/epics/.../stories/s{N}.{M}-story.md` | + |
| start | `work/epics/.../stories/s{N}.{M}-scope.md` | + |
| design | `work/epics/.../stories/s{N}.{M}-design.md` | + |
| plan | `work/epics/.../stories/s{N}.{M}-plan.md` | + |
| implement | `src/path/to/file.py` | ~ |
| implement | `tests/path/to/test.py` | ~ |
| review | `work/epics/.../stories/s{N}.{M}-retrospective.md` | + |

### Metrics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tests | {count} passed |
| Commits | {total_count} across {phases_count} phases |
| Patterns | {PAT-IDs or "none"} |
| Jira | {ticket} → {status} |
```

File paths MUST use backticks so they are clickable in the terminal. Use actual paths, not placeholders — the table above is a template.

## Output

| Item | Destination |
|------|-------------|
| All story artifacts | `work/epics/e{N}-{name}/stories/` |
| Merge commit | Parent branch (epic or dev) |
| Patterns | `.raise/rai/memory/patterns.jsonl` |
| Calibration | Via `rai signal emit-calibration` |
| Next | Next story or `/rai-epic-close` |

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Phase detection checked in reverse order (most advanced first)
- [ ] Delegation resolved from profile before starting chain
- [ ] All 8 phases spawn Agent tool subagent with full SKILL.md as prompt
- [ ] Each subagent gets fresh context — no conversation history passed
- [ ] Artifact-producing forks verified by checking file on disk
- [ ] AR/QR verdicts read from agent return value
- [ ] Gates applied at post-design, post-implement, post-AR, and post-QR (in main thread)
- [ ] Failure stops immediately — no cascading to next phase
- [ ] NEVER create a state file — phase detection is git-derived only
- [ ] NEVER skip a skill in the chain (even if developer says "just close it")
- [ ] NEVER pass conversation context to forked subagent — only disk artifacts + SKILL.md
